## Project Objectives

The following assignment seeks to apply the natural learning process (NLP) to understand the sentitment in the latest news articles related to Cryptocurrency featuring coins such as; Bitcoin and Ethereum. Using NLP fundamental techniques will help better understand other relevant factors involved with coin prices such as; common words, phrases, organizations, and entities mentioned in the selected articles. 

### Part 1: Sentiment Analysis

Part one of the homework assignment utilizes the [News API Client](https://newsapi.org/), to pull the latest articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum to conduct a sentiment analysis. Additionally, a DataFrame is created to capture the sentiment scores for each coin and respond to analysis questions. 

### Part 2: Natural Learning Process

This section of the assignmnet uses NLTK and Python processes to tokenize text, find Ngrams, and create word clouds for Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

**Processes Utilized in Part 2:**

- Tokenize
- Ngrams and Word Frequency Analysis
- Word Clouds
